# WHAT: Wetland Hydrological Analysis Tools

<!-- badges: start -->

[![Project Status: Concept - Minimal or no implementation has been done
yet, or the repository is only intended to be a limited example, demo,
or
proof-of-concept.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/concept.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#concept)

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of WHAT is to support analysis of near real-time hydrological
data from Point Blue’s [Water
Tracker](https://www.pointblue.org/watertracker) to summarize the timing
of operational modes relevant to water use in managed wetland units,
such as flood-up, maintenance of full ponds, draw-down, irrigation, or
no water supply.

## Installation

You can install the development version of WHAT from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pointblue/WHAT")
```

<!-- ## Example -->
<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->
<!-- ```{r example} -->
<!-- library(WHAT) -->
<!-- ## basic example code -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->
<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->
<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->
<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->

## Funding Statement

This package is under development as part of the project “California
Central Valley Wetlands Water Budget Tool Development”, Grant
No. R21AP10037-00, a WaterSMART (Sustain and Manage America’s Resources
for Tomorrow) Applied Science Grant from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.
